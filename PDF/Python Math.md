# Python Math:

Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

### Built-in Math Functions:

The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

```
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y)

#out:# 5
#out:# 25
```
> 5
> 25

The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

```
x = abs(-7.25)

print(x)
```

> 7.25
