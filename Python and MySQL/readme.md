Python can be used in database applications.

One of the most popular databases is MySQL.

# MySQL Database:
To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.

You can download a free MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.

Install MySQL Driver
Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.

In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".

We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".

PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.

Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following:

> Download and install "MySQL Connector":

```
C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Now you have downloaded and installed a MySQL driver.

### Test MySQL Connector:

To test if the installation was successful, or if you already have "MySQL Connector" installed, create a Python page with the following content:

> demo_mysql_test.py:
