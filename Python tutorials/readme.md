# Machine Learning:

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. 

Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). 

Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

# Python Math:

Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Python RegEx:

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

# Python Try Except:

The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

The except block lets you handle the error.

The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
